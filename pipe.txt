Data Generation:
- Absence of Classical Code Pattern
- Great Number of iterations
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Training:
- Greater Batch size
- Sequential Batch Sampling
- Multi GPU
- Tensor Precision tf32 and bf16
- Greater Context window (512)

Evaluation:
- Precision problem from the way the model was trained ??

------------------------------------------------------------
xp: remove tensor Precision (today)
xp: Randomize Batch Sampling
xp: reduce batch size back
xp: Reduce Context window back

----------------
xp-1:
Category 1: Big Batch Size => Multiple-GPU : bs = 512
	- Vanilla : no tensor precision, context window 256, random batch sampling
	- Vanilla + tf32
	- Vanilla + context window = 512
	- Vanilla + sequential sampling

Category 2: Go back to low batch size bs = 64 <=> One GPU:
	-
