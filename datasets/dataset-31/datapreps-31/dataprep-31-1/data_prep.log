Split by examples using \n\n:
	--> splitting
	--> freeing data memory
	--> total number of examples: 9,700,000


Creating the train.txt, val.txt and test.txt:

NOT shuffling examples:
	--> creating the train_examples
	--> train_examples has 9650000 examples
	--> creating the train_data
	--> writing the train_data to train.txt
	--> creating the val_examples
	--> val_examples has 25000 examples
	--> creating the val_data
	--> writing the val_data to val.txt
	--> creating the test_examples
	--> test_examples has 25000 examples
	--> creating the test_data
	--> test_data has 103085809 tokens
	--> writing the test_data to test.txt
	--> freeing examples memory

We generate the tokenized file of train.txt:

We generate the tokenized file of val.txt:
