# Tiny Language Models Framework

This repository contains the implementation and resources for the Tiny Language Models Framework project. In this project, we developed small-scale language models to facilitate detailed research into various aspects of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of code.

We've also prepared a [TinyLM Starter Notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nairmarwa/tinylm-starter-notebook). This notebook is designed to help you get started quickly with our project. It guides you through training a tiny language model from scratch using our dataset and evaluating its performance on code execution tasks.

## Requirements
We've used Python 3.11.7.

To install the required packages, you can use the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Generation
Generate the data using TinyPy Generator by running : 

```bash
cd data/
python tinypy_generator.py --num_programs 1000 --level 1.1 --filename sample_data.txt --deduplicate
```

This generation command is just an example to get you started. If you want to train your own model, you'll likely need to generate significantly more data. 

### Data Preparation
Prepare (tokenize and split) the data by running:

```bash
python prepare.py
```

### Training
Train the model using the following command:

bash
```bash
cd ..
python train.py --batch_size 64 --max_iters 35000 --learning_rate 0.01 --miles 0.7 0.8 0.9 --eval_interval 10000 --eval_iters 500 --data_dir data
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on code execution by running:

```bash
python code_execution.py --dataset_dir data --model_name arithmetics_level1_696K
```

### Demonstration
To see a demonstration of the model's capabilities, open the demonstration.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions within.

### Generalization
This section aims to generalize the results obtained from training tiny language models to large language models. This can be achieved through fine-tuning Code LLaMa.

#### Fine-tuning
Fine-tune Code LLaMa model using the following command:

```bash
cd generalization/
python finetune.py  --train_dataset_path data/tokenized_train --val_dataset_path data/tokenized_val --output_dir models/code-llama-finetuned-demo
```

#### Evaluation
Evaluate the fine-tuned Code LLaMa model by running:

```bash
python code_execution.py --checkpoint_dir models/code-llama-finetuned-level1 --test_file data/test.txt --output_file results/result_llama.txt --csv_file results/results_llama.csv 
```

#### Demonstration
To see a demonstration of the model's capabilities, open the generalization/demonstration.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions within.
