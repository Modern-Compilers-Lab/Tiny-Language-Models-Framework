Importing ...:
	--> took (0, 0, 0, 1)

Starting the netpune logging:
	--> neptune init
	--> saving the runid

Set the random seed for reproducibility:

Set the device to GPU if available, otherwise CPU:
	--> device set to cuda:0.

Setting arch-hyperparams for the GPT model:

Loading the training and evaluation data:
	--> train.bin
	--> took (0, 0, 0, 2)
	--> val.bin
	--> took (0, 0, 0, 0)

Setting train-hyperparams and util variables:
	--> max_iters = 222562

Defining the model and utilities:

The model:
	--> def get random batch of data
	--> def estimate loss
	--> def human readable

Loading the meta object:
	--> loading
	--> setting vocab size

Creating the model:

The model has 30M trainable parameters:

Preparing for the training loop:
	--> initialiazing the optimizer
	--> initializing the learing rate scheduler
	--> computing the initial loss
